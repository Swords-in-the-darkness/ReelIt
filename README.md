## Concept
Inspired by community-built databases informed by user-generated content, _Reel It_ provides movie info that extends beyond the credits and critics. 

Currently, _Reel It_ allows users to search Movie Titles — rendering robust details including:
* Plot 
* Cast/crew 
* FCC rating 
* Release date
* Trailers
* Audience Ratings & Reviews
* Direct links to purchase, rent, or stream movies 
* Additional options to narrow or expand one's search based on genre, cast/crew, recommendations, popular videos, and related content. 


## Future Directions
* Expand search categories to include TV shows, albums, podcasts, books, and more. 
* Allow users to create account where they can submit reviews and provide ratings.
* Allow users to select from an autocomplete suggestion drop-down menu of relevant and validated search criteria. 

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap, Google Fonts)
* JavaScript/jQuery
* JSON/JSONP
* AJAX
