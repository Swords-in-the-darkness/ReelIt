[Reel It - Heroku](https://reel-it.herokuapp.com/)

## Concept
Fueled by user-generated content, _Reel It_ provides movie info that extends beyond the credits and critics. 

Currently, _Reel It_ allows users to search Movie Titles â€” rendering robust details including:
* Plot 
* Cast/crew 
* FCC rating 
* Release date
* Trailers
* Audience Ratings & Reviews
* Direct links to purchase, rent, or stream movies 
* Additional options to narrow or expand one's search based on genre, cast/crew, recommendations, popular videos, and related content. 


## Future Directions
Future directions include expanding search criteria to categories like TV shows, albums, podcasts, books, and more.
